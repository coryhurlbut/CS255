Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The DriverPass poject was requested by the boss of DriverPass. They want to expand their business to a mobile device platform and increase their efectiveness with    several major features. It will handle all of the scheduling of stringing drives as well as hold testing and feedback functions.
What did you do particularly well?
  I felt most confident with tuning the requirements into a usable design and taking the most out of the requirements.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I think I could make the most improvement on my system design documents. They could have been iterated to become more thorough. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I focused on what the user wanted in the application and how I could deliver it in the best way possible while maintaining other focuses like performance.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I really like simple wireframes as it is the best way for my to get my thoughts organized. I need to make it a bit more formal so it is more useful to the team but I like the freedom and simplicity of wireframing on paper.
